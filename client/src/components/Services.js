         <h2>Full Groom</h2>
         <p> The "Full Groom" service includes a good bath, ear cleaning, nail trim, teeth brushing, gland expression (upon request), blow dry, sanitary trim, paw trim, and full body haircut.</p>

         <h2>Tidy Up</h2>
         <p>The "Tidy Up" service is a step down from the full groom. The only difference is we are not taking any length off of the body. The "Tidy Up" includes a good bath, ear cleaning, nail trim, teeth brushing, gland expression (request only), blow dry, paw trim, and a sanitary trim.</p>
         <h4>At the end of ALL of our grooms, your pup will get a spritz of our seasonal cologne and your choice of a bow or bandana!</h4>
