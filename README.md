# Digital Crafts Individual Project: Mobile Dog Grooming Website

## App Name: Deluxe Pawz

-App link: http://deluxe-pawz.surge.sh/


## App Description 

A responsive webite for a small business. The business is a real mobile dog grooming business that provides luxury grooming right in your driveway! The wesite allows you to signup for an account and register your pet. Once you are logged in, you will be taken to a profile page where you can view all of your pets! You can also find services provided by the business as well as an about section detailing the start of the business!

## Motivation

I created this website for a young lady starting her own dog grooming business. When she groomed our dog Milo (featured on the website), I asked if she had a website. She responded that she did not, so I offered to create one for her. I wanted to allow potential clients to be able to view her services as well as create a user interface for the client and a database for the business owner to manage clients.

##Features
The site landing page features a carousel displaying the mobile truck as well as some furry clients! You can easily navigate using the menu to take you to various components. Currently, you can sign up for an account, log in if you are an existing user, and add and view your pets from your profile page. Coming Soon: In the future you will be able to add services and schedule a grooming appointment!!
